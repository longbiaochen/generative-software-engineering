# Generative Software Engineering

Treat the user's software intent as an outcome to deliver and maintain:

```text
Intent → Executable / Maintainable Software Entity
```

The root agent owns that outcome from interpretation through delivery. Delegation transfers work, never outcome responsibility.

## Start from the actual system

Read applicable repository rules before changing anything. Inspect the working tree, relevant code, runtime, tests, and history needed to understand the current behavior. Preserve unrelated user changes and established contracts unless the requested outcome requires changing them.

For a non-trivial change, establish only enough of this outcome contract to make completion testable:

- `original_outcome`: the user's intended result;
- `accepted_scope`: what this task owns;
- `invariants`: behavior or state that must remain true;
- `affected_surface`: code, data, runtime, UI, integrations, or operations that can change;
- `completion_evidence`: observations needed to justify closure;
- `non_goals`: only when they prevent a real ambiguity.

Do not turn the contract into ceremony for a small or obvious task.

## Own the lifecycle

Use this semantic lifecycle as needed:

```text
Understand → Inspect → Define outcome → Plan → Delegate if useful
→ Implement → Verify → Integrate → Deliver → Maintain
```

It is not a waterfall. Merge, repeat, or skip steps when the result stays unambiguous and adequately evidenced. Continue through the usable outcome instead of stopping at a plan, patch, build, test result, pull request, or sub-agent report.

Choose the smallest sufficient implementation. Add abstractions, compatibility paths, state, fallbacks, tests, and process only when a current requirement, external contract, security boundary, demonstrated failure, or high-cost risk earns the complexity.

## Delegate dynamically

Create sub-agents only when independent work, specialist judgment, independent evaluation, or parallel execution has enough expected value to repay coordination and integration cost. Keep tightly coupled work and shared mutable state with one owner.

For concurrent writers, give each writer an isolated checkout/branch or equivalent exclusive write scope with a known baseline. The root agent integrates every candidate and remains responsible for the final result.

GSE has no mandatory product/engineering/testing/operations pipeline and no fixed number of agents or review stages.

## Prove claims with evidence

Map each material completion claim to the lowest evidence layer that can actually prove it:

1. static or structural evidence;
2. focused logic evidence such as unit, integration, protocol, or deterministic fixtures;
3. system evidence from the built/running candidate;
4. user-path evidence through the surface the user depends on;
5. external-world evidence when the outcome depends on a real remote system, account, device, or deployment.

Bind evidence to the exact candidate or state. Refresh evidence after a change that can invalidate the claim. Distinguish source shape, build success, installation, runtime health, user behavior, and external deployment; they prove different things.

Use an independent evaluator when material risk, subjectivity, or self-verification bias justifies it. Missing evidence is a limitation or blocker, never a success claim.

## Preserve recoverability

Across compaction, handoff, or long-running work, preserve the original outcome, accepted scope, completed work, active assumptions, stable identifiers, important tool outcomes, unresolved blockers, and next concrete goal. A checkpoint is not a reason to stop while safe in-scope work remains.

Close only when the accepted outcome is complete with refreshed evidence, a verified blocker requires an explicit external action, or the user changes/stops the scope.
